""" 
Multiple Inheritence : a class is derived from more than one base class it is called multiple Inheritance. The derived class inherits all the features of the base case.


Method Resolution Order : In Python, every class whether built-in or user-defined is derived from the object class and all the objects are instances of the class object. Hence, the object class is the base class for all the other classes.
In the case of multiple inheritance, a given attribute is first searched in the current class if itâ€™s not found then it's searched in the parent classes. The parent classes are searched in a left-right fashion and each class is searched once.
